Image Style Conversion

Introduction

Super resolution convolutional neural network (SRCNN) is end-to-end mapping between LR images and corresponding HR images. 
SRCNN has experimentally verified that adjusting the number of networkâ€™s layer, 
the size of filter and the number of filters in each layer can have effect on reconstruction results.

I include train and test code in master branch.
The model 'vgg-verydeep-19' is also included in /data.
(Your GPU memory should >= 6GB)




How to train & test

1.You may compile matconvnet first by running gpu_compile.m  (you need to change some setting in it)

2.Use test_vgg19.m to have fun~
