I include train and test code in master branch.
The model 'vgg-verydeep-19' is also included in /data.
(Your GPU memory should >= 6GB)

# How to train & test
1.You may compile matconvnet first by running gpu_compile.m  (you need to change some setting in it)

For more compile information, you can learn it from www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/install/#compiling

2.Use test_vgg19.m to have fun~
